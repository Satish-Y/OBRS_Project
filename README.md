Key Features:

Home Page (index.jsp):
A simple and intuitive homepage that directs users to either the User Bike List or the Admin Login page.

Admin Login (adminLogin.jsp):
A secure login page for administrators to access the bike registration functionalities.

Bike Registration (bikeRegistration.jsp):
A form for administrators to register new bikes, including fields for bike name, model, and price.

Bike List for Users (userBikeList.jsp):
A page displaying a list of all registered bikes, accessible to users without needing to log in.

CRUD Operations for Bikes:
Functionality for admins to create, read, update, and delete bike entries, ensuring comprehensive management of bike data.

Data Persistence with MySQL:
Use of MySQL for storing bike data, ensuring reliable data persistence and retrieval.

Technical Stack:
Frontend: JSP, HTML, CSS for creating dynamic web pages.
Backend: Java Servlets for handling business logic and interactions with the database.
Database: MySQL for data storage and management.
Server: Apache Tomcat for deploying and running the web application.

Project Structure:

Dynamic Web Project Setup:
A structured approach to setting up the project in an IDE (e.g., Eclipse), including the addition of necessary libraries.

Servlets:
AdminLoginServlet.java for handling admin login.
BikeRegistrationServlet.java for processing bike registration.
BikeListServlet.java for displaying the list of bikes.
DeleteBikeServlet.java for deleting bike entries.
EditBikeServlet.java for editing bike entries.
UserDataDisplayServlet.java for displaying bike data to users.

JSP Pages:
index.jsp, adminLogin.jsp, bikeRegistration.jsp, userBikeList.jsp for UI and interaction.

Conclusion:
This project serves as an excellent example of a web application that integrates various Java EE components, providing a practical solution for bike registration and management. The clear separation of frontend and backend functionalities ensures maintainability and scalability. By following the provided steps, developers can easily understand and expand the project, making it a valuable resource for learning and development.

Potential Enhancements:
User Authentication: Adding user registration and authentication for personalized services.
Validation: Implementing more robust input validation and error handling.
Responsive Design: Enhancing the UI for better accessibility on mobile devices.
RESTful APIs: Providing RESTful APIs for integration with other systems or mobile applications.
